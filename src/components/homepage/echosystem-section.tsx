          Your Echosystem is your personal content universe. It is not a tool. It is not a template.
          It is a living, learning extension of your voice. Every video you upload, every thought you record,
          every word you have already created—Echo absorbs it all. It learns your cadence, your vocabulary,
          your perspective. Then it creates new content that does not sound like AI. It sounds like you.
          Because it is trained on you. Your Echosystem grows smarter with every upload. The more you feed it,
          the more it becomes you.
