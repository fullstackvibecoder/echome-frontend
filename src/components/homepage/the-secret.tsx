            Most AI tools generate content from a massive, generic dataset. That is why it all sounds the same.
            Bland. Safe. Forgettable.

          <p>
            <strong className="text-text-primary">Echo works backwards.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Before it writes a single word, it studies you. Every video you upload, every voice note you record,
            every past post you sync—Echo analyzes your vocabulary, sentence structure, humor, references,
            even your punctuation style.
          </p>

          <p>
            It builds a neural fingerprint of your voice. Then when you ask it to create content, it does not
            pull from a generic AI brain. It pulls from your Echo. Your knowledge. Your tone. Your personality.
          </p>

          <p className="text-accent font-bold">
            The more you upload, the more "you" it gets. This is not content generation. This is voice cloning
            for the written word.
